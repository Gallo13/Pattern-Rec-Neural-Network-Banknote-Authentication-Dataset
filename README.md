PART 1
--------------------------------------
Listing 1:
  a. Load Libraries
  b. Load the Dataset (BANKNOTE AUTHENTICATION DATASET USED)

Listing 2:
Dimensions of the datatse. Peek at the data itself. Statistical summary of all attributes. 
Breakdown of the data by the class variable.
  a. Print the shape of the dataset
  b. Print the first few rows of the dataset
  c. Print the statistical description of the dataset
  d. Print the class distribution in the dataset

Listing 3:
Univariate plots to better understand each attribute. Multivariate plots to better understand 
the relationships between attributes.
  a. Univariate Plot
  b. Visualize the dataset using Histogram Plots
  c. Visualize the dataset using Scatter Plots

Listing 4:
  a. Create validation set
  b. Build models (Loigistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbors,
  Classification and Regression Trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines.
  c. Compare algorithms

Listing 5:
Make prediction on the validation dataset
